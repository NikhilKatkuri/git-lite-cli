   ```

6. **Test the CLI**:
   ```bash
   npm run cli
   ```

## Development Workflow

### Before You Start

1. **Check existing issues** to see if your bug/feature is already being worked on
2. **Create an issue** for new bugs or features to discuss the approach
3. **Assign yourself** to the issue you want to work on

### Making Changes

1. **Create a new branch** for your feature/fix:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/issue-description
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following our coding standards
3. **Test your changes** thoroughly
4. **Commit your changes** with clear, descriptive messages

### Commit Message Guidelines

We follow conventional commit standards:

- `feat:` for new features
- `fix:` for bug fixes
- `docs:` for documentation changes
- `style:` for formatting changes
- `refactor:` for code refactoring
- `test:` for adding tests
- `chore:` for maintenance tasks

Examples:

```
feat: add branch deletion functionality
fix: resolve authentication token validation issue
docs: update installation instructions
```

### Code Style and Standards

- **TypeScript**: Use TypeScript for all new code
- **ESLint**: Follow the ESLint configuration
- **Prettier**: Use Prettier for code formatting
- **File Structure**: Follow the existing project structure

#### Before Committing

Run these commands to ensure code quality:

```bash
# Check formatting and linting
npm run check

# Auto-fix formatting and linting issues
npm run fix

# Build to ensure no compilation errors
npm run build
```

## Testing

Currently, the project doesn't have automated tests, but manual testing is crucial:

1. **Test the CLI** with `npm run cli`
2. **Test all features** you've modified
3. **Test edge cases** and error scenarios
4. **Ensure authentication works** with GitHub tokens
5. **Test on different operating systems** if possible

## Submitting Changes

### Pull Request Process

1. **Update your branch** with the latest upstream changes:

   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git rebase upstream/main
   ```

2. **Push your changes** to your fork:

   ```bash
   git push origin your-branch-name
   ```

3. **Create a Pull Request** on GitHub with:
   - Clear title describing the change
   - Detailed description of what was changed and why
   - Reference to related issues (if any)
   - Screenshots or examples (if applicable)

### Pull Request Guidelines

- **Keep PRs focused**: One feature or fix per PR
- **Write clear descriptions**: Explain what, why, and how
- **Include tests**: Add or update tests when applicable
- **Update documentation**: Update README or docs if needed
- **Be responsive**: Address review feedback promptly

## Project Structure

Understanding the codebase structure will help you contribute effectively:

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ index.ts              # Main entry point
â”œâ”€â”€ auth/                 # Authentication modules
â”œâ”€â”€ services/             # Core services (create, push, etc.)

4. Test the command thoroughly

### Adding New Utilities

1. Place utility functions in `src/utils/`
2. Follow existing naming conventions
3. Add appropriate TypeScript types
4. Document complex functions
